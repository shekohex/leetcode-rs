<p align="center" style="font-weight:bold;">Learning Rust By Solving Leetcode Problems.</p>

## Introduction 💭

**I believe the best way to learn and improve your skills is by practicing and the best way to do so is by solving problems, a lot of problems.**

Fortunately, [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) has a lot of them, and here we are attempting to provide (hopefully) the best and idiomatic solutions for these problems hoping that will help you find new ways to think in Rust.

## Getting Starting 🙋

We are assuming that you have Rust installed already, if not please 💁 [do](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

All solutions are organized in separate directories according to there difficulty level (easy, medium, hard), and every solution is provided as library and all code should be contained in one single file (usually `lib.rs`), for example the [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) should be located in [`easy/two-sum/src/lib.rs`](easy/two-sum/src/lib.rs).

## Index 📑

Here you can find the list of solved problems:

- [Easy](easy/README.md).
- [Medium](medium/README.md).
- [Hard](hard/README.md).

## Contributing 👋
